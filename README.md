This repo offers code snippets for the paper titled "Deep Learning Models For Multiword Expression Identification" (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S17-1006). The goal was to explore the effectiveness of various deep learning approaches (Vanilla neural networks, CNNs, and RNNs) for identifying multiword expressions. I realize that the code written here is messy (and I have stopped writing code like this eversince) but the goal is to provide some inspiration to any researchers who want to know the details of the approach and/or how it was implemented in practice. 

Feel free to create an issue if there is anything that is unclear and I will try to address it as soon as possible.
